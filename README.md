# üé≠ Emotion Detection Using Facial Expression

Welcome to the *Emotion Detection Using Facial Expression* project! This repository contains a CNN-based model to classify facial expressions into different emotions, as well as a Flask-based web application to demonstrate the model in real-time using a webcam feed. üì∏

## üìë Project Overview

This project leverages deep learning to recognize seven different emotions from facial expressions:
- *Angry*
- *Disgust*
- *Fear*
- *Happy*
- *Neutral*
- *Sad*
- *Surprise*

### Key Features
- *Emotion Recognition Model*: Developed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the FER-2013 dataset.
- *Real-Time Detection*: Flask application to capture webcam feed and detect emotions in real-time.
- *Interactive UI*: Simple HTML/CSS interface to display detected emotions.
